# 👋 Hi, I'm Karen Jo 

 :woman_technologist: I'm a Frontend Development fulltime student at Noroff 
    
 📍 Based in Trondheim, Norway

###   💡 Former Education
        Bachelor's degree + Postgraduate Degree in Practical Teacher Education (PPU) from NTNU
        Jurisprudence, Law from Høgskolen i Innlandet (INN) (1 year)

### ⚡ Interests
        I am a hobby drawer and painter who enjoys creating art and writing comics. 
        I maintain an active lifestyle by lifting weights, snowboarding freeriding,
        running 10k-30k outdoors, and cross-country skiing.
    

### 💻 I'm currently working on

#### Project Exam 2: Holidaze
Currently working with an official API documentation, planning, designing, and building a front-end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and the admin-facing side where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
